# general notes

# chatGPT

Has two models. One which is free and one which is $20 a month.  The paid version is newer, has a larger prompt capability and faster.

# Google

Has a developer version available via google labs.  Where is the link I used to sign up?

# General guidelines for usage

* the examples for chatGPT use a "Please _verb_ _noun_ with _context_
* google chat works with simple queries as you would type in search. "keyword keyword keyword"
* proper grammar, spelling and punctuation was mentioned as giving better results

# Hallucinations

The datacamp class mentions an example on summarizing a linkedIN url which does not exist.   ChatGPT provides a summary for a person who does not exist.  It does this without telling the user.

# copyright

Given a prompt to write new song lyrics in the style of a well known singer, a song can be written.  However the question is who owns the copyright to the new lyrics?  

* The singer who was used a mode?
* open.ai?
* The user of open.ai's chatGPT?

# generalized vs specialized models

A model trained primarily on code would be considered a specialized model.  Consquently, it would
be better suited to generate code than a generalized model.

# bias

As models become more sophisticated, they tend to have more training data.  As the training is increasingly larger, its more difficult to remove bias.  One needs to cognizant that bias is a constant concern.
