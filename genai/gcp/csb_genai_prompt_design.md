# Generative AI with Vertex AI: Prompt Design

In this lab, you will learn about prompt design and various text generation use cases using the Vertex AI PaLM API.

It does not use the GoogleCloudPlatform repo.  It uses a different [one]( https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/language/prompts/intro_prompt_design.ipynb).

Do this one
* language/prompts/intro_prompt_design.ipynb	Notebook covering best practices for prompt design
Do any of these
* language/prompts/examples/ideation.ipynb	Notebook on how to use the PaLM APIs for idea generation, brainstorming, writing
* language/prompts/examples/question_answering.ipynb	Notebook on how to use the PaLM APIs for question-answering
* language/prompts/examples/text_classification.ipynb	Notebook on how to use the PaLM APIs for classifying text
* language/prompts/examples/text_extraction.ipynb	Notebook on how to use the PaLM APIs for extracting information from text
* language/prompts/examples/text_summarization.ipynb	Notebook on how to use the PaLM APIs for summarizing text

The last lab used these which look similar:
The first notebook also demos the code models.
* language/getting-started/intro_palm_api.ipynb	Notebook on getting started with the Vertex AI PaLM API & Python SDK
* language/getting-started/intro_generative_ai_studio.md	UI-based tutorial on getting started with Generative AI Studio
